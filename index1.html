 	<p>   Hello, my name is Chris Chen, a senior student. I am an international student from China. I born in a small city in the north part of China. In my family, I am the only child, I had a best childhood, which is being said I can get all the love from my parents. It doesn't mean my family could take care of me forever, I need to be independent. So I came to America, to grow up, to study. I also really have a good time here, know many new friends, learn a lot.<br>This is my CSP project website, which you can know the basic infomation about me. By doing this project, I learned a lot of making a website with css and html. As I learned more and more, I expected more and more from this course. Creating a website is a <strong>delicate task</strong>, and there is much I need to learn about it. I watched some youtube vedios and use the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"><em>"https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" </em></a> for a lot of helps. It is a great website, which we can get millions of information.</p>
