 	<p>   Hello, my name is Chris Chen, a senior student. This is my CSP project website. You can know the basic infomation about me from it. By doing this project, I learned a lot of making a website with css and html. As I learned more and more, I expected more and more from this course. Creating a website is a <strong>delicate task</strong>, and there is much I need to learn about it. I watched some youtube vedios and use the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"><em>"https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" </em></a> for a lot of helps. It is a great website, which we can get millions of information.</p>
