  <p>   Hello, my name is Chris Chen, a senior student. I am an international student from China. I born in a small city in the north part of China. In my family, I am the only child, I had a best childhood, which is being said I can get all the love from my parents. It doesn't mean my family could take care of me forever, I need to be independent. Now I have grown up, can leave their parents alone to go out, but my mother is still not trust me, all the things, no matter how big, still want to intervene in a tube. I said to my mother, mother I have grown up, one day, is to leave you, is to go to the society independently.<span id="dots">..</span><span id="more">

Parents' love for their children is understandable, but sometimes the way is wrong. Parents have good intentions and are motivated by love for their children. But sometimes the love of parents, to the children is the trouble and hurt. I want to tell my mother that I have grown up, I have the life I want, I want my life can be their own decision. From childhood to adulthood, my study, my love life and my job are all decisions you made for me. This is not the life I want. This is not my life. I want my life to be my own. Maybe I should try to understand my parents love me, they just stand in their point of view, stand in their point of view how I do life will be better. In fact, it is just to impose their so-called love on me, which is probably a common fault of Chinese parents. If I had become a father in the future, I would not have interfered with my children's lives or decisions as much as my parents did.

I want my life to be my own and I want to choose a career that I love, no matter how much or how little it pays. I want to choose the person I like, no matter she is poor or rich. I have a simple wish that I can make my own decisions about my life. Mom and dad, I have grown up, please let go. Leave your wings and protection, I believe I will fly higher and farther. So I came to America, to grow up, to study. I also really have a good time here, know many new friends, learn a lot.<br>This is my CSP project website, which you can know the basic infomation about me. By doing this project, I learned a lot of making a website with css and html. As I learned more and more, I expected more and more from this course. Creating a website is a <strong>delicate task</strong>, and there is much I need to learn about it. I watched some youtube vedios and use the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp"><em>"https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp" </em></a> for a lot of helps. It is a great website, which we can get millions of information.
